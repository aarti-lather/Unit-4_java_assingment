 What is the 3NF? Explain with an example. You donâ€™t need to draw the
        tables or write the queries. Just mention the schema before and after the
        third normal form.


        answer:- relation is with 2NF and transitive dependency for non-prime attributes.(entity are non-transitively dependent on the primary key.)

        a realtion is in 3NP if it hold atleaset one condition in non-trivial function dependency
        X-->Y;
        1)In this X is a super key;
        2) Y is a prime attribute;

        if we have A-->B and B-->C and somehow A is depend on C or A-->C this is transitive dependency;


        transitive dependency:- when one column depends on a colum which is not prime key.



        schema before 3NF====(studentID,studentName,studentZip,studentState,studentDistrict);

        schema after 3NF====studentTable(studentID,studentZip,studentName);
                        studentZipTable(studentZip,studentState,studentDistrict);

        ques3)
        Briefly explain what a transaction is along with the ACID properties.

        answer: :-
        A logical unit of work on a database and action or series performed by a single user which reads and update the
        content of the DB(series of action that perform  read and update.Transaction  must follow ACID.


        example:-
        there is a packing system where money i  widraw form one account and  added in another account , that will be
        considered as transaction .(deducting the value then added and then commited);

        A-----> atomicity
        C-----> consistency
        I-----> isolation
        D----->  DEurability


        atomicity:
        atomicity means the entire  transction take place at once or does not happend at all;
        if system fails in between then it will not commited;
        example :-
        there is two entities    A and B;
        money is deduct from A and added in B that means the total amount is same;

        C-----> consistency:-
        consistency measn correctness
        the amount before the transaction and after the transcation is same
        EXAMPLE:-
        before transcation  A have  500 rupyes and B have 300rs( and the total of thse is 500+300=800)
        after  transfer 100 rs  A have 400rs and B have 400rs  (400+400=800)(total money should be same)


        I-----> isolation:-
        1) multiple transcation can occure concurrently
        2) transction occur independently.
        3) changing occuring in one transaction will not visible to other transaction


        example:-
        if money is widrawl  the money it should not  its not effect someother  deduction of money, (it is independent)



        D----->  DEurability:-
        once the transaction  is commited , the update and modification to the database are store in and written to disk
        exapmle:-
        banking system failure.
        the effect of transaction is never lost it always permanent.
