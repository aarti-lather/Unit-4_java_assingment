and responsibility

Answer:--->
An Operating System is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which
performs all the basic tasks like memory management, process management, input and output, and
controlling  devices  those devices that are linked either internally or externally to a computer.(disk drives and printers)


some Operating Systems are :-
1)  Linux
2)  Windows
3)  Android


  functions of an operating System:----


  File Management
  Proessor Managemnet
  Security
  Job Accounting
  Coordination between other software and users
  Memory Management
  Device Management


 Memory Management:-
                    The term Memory can be defined as a collection of data in a specific format.
Memory management refers to management of Primary Memory or Main Memory, In main memeory there  are large number of  bytes which have its own address.



File Management:---
                   File Management is use for file maintenance operations, its manage the data files in a computer system
                    It has limited capabilities ans designed to manage individual or group of files

Device Management:----
                  Device Management in OS means controlling the I/O devices like microphone,keyboards, printer, Scanner

Question 2:-

What is CAP theorem, discuss a scenario where CAP theorem helps you choose a
technology over the other or helps you make a design decision.

Answer:-
The CAP theorem is a belief from theoretical computer science about distributed data stores that claims, in the event of a network failure on a distributed database,
it is possible to provide either consistency or availabilityâ€”but not both.

any distributed system guarantees any two of the three stated later.
1)  Consistency  (All reads receive the most recent write or an error.)
2)  Availability (All reads contain data, but it might not be recent.)
3)  Partition Tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of
    a part of the system).

What is caching, explain its use cases?

it is the memory which is very nearest to the CPU, all recent information are stored into cache memory
The data in a cache is  stored  RAM (Random-access memory) and may also be used in correlation with a software component.
Caches are used everywhere in our modern devices. It's found in many hardware components and throughout software.
 The goal of caching is to store data from slow memory into fast memory so it can be retrieved quicker
Use Cases:-
1.Database Caching.
2.CDN(Content Delivery Network)
3.Web Caching.
4.RDBMS Speedup
5.Integrated Cache.
6.General Cache.
7.Token Caching

 what are web sockets where it is used.
 ANswer===
 The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server
 Its allow both the server and the client to push messages at any time. Almost every borser supports Websockets
 also solve HTTP issues:-
                        )Full-duplex communication ----->  client and server can talk to each other independently(same time)
                        Bi-directional protocol:----> client/server can send a message to the other party

                       *) when connections are terminated  its can't recover automatically.we have to implement ourself


uses:

 Multiplayer games
 Multimedia Chats
 editing/coding
 Social feed
 Financial tickers

    How are public and private keys used in encryption and decryption?
Answer:
public and private keys  both are commonly used for encryption and decryption.

It is an encryption technique that uses a pair of keys for
secure data communication.
 In the pair of keys,
  public key -----> encrypting (the plain text to convert it into ciphertext),public key is provided to the public
  private key ----->used for decrypting (the ciphertext to read the message.), it given to the receiver

All asymmetric key pairs are unique, so a message only be read by the person who has the corresponding private key
